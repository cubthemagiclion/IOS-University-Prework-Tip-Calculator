# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator with Slider Bar*

**Tip Calculator with Slider Bar** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Yujing Chen**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] The user is able to use either a slider bar or the segmented control to change the tip percentage. If the user changed the segmented control, then the sliding bar will be updated as well. (Although not the other way around)

## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered was getting used to use Xcode. I did not use it before and sometimes I found it difficult to show the windows I wanted it to show, etc.
